# code-quiz
How it works:
You will be asked 4 questions with 50 seconds to answer all 4 questions. With which wrong answer you will be penalized with 30 seconds taken off the clock. 
Once you are finished with the quiz you will be asked to enter your initials and submit them to the highscore page, where they will be kept in local storage unless you hit the clear button, which will clear all high scores. 
After you are finished with entering your initials you can click the go back button which will take you to the beginning of the game.
